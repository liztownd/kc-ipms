                    <h4>International Paper Money Show</h4>
                    <p>This year, for the 44th time, the IPMS will continue its history of
                        bringing the world of Paper Money and Banknotes as part of the fabric of currency since the
                        beginning of time.

                        I have said for years if you want to talk paper money you need to come to the IPMS. This show is
                        dedicated to currency, which by its definition is “a system of money in general use in a
                        particular
                        country”. Currency is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which
                        is
                        issued by a country and circulated within an economy. Used as a medium of exchange for good sand
                        services, it is the basis for trade.

                        This event has non-stop action for those who collect, investigate, buy, sell, and trade
                        currencies
                        of the world, but primarily made of paper, polymer, tyvek, seal skin, wood, plastic and to a
                        more
                        limited extent, gold, silver, copper, platinum, and materials used in trade.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Our convention space is located within the Sheraton Hotel perfectly positioned inside the Crown
                        Center Complex. The famous HALL family had built the Complex as the corporate headquarters for
                        Hallmark Cards. Obviously there is a difference between designing greeting cards and designing
                        banknotes. However, we feel both require a major amount of talent and artistry and will provide
                        a strong sense of camaraderie for the event.</p>

                    <p>The Crown Center complex offers an all inclusive shopping and entertainment venue, complete with
                        live theatre, casual and fine dining, mixed with a wide array of educational and nightlife
                        experiences. So much to do day or night and it’s all within walking distance through a a series
                        of climate controlled glass walkways.</p>

                    <p>While in Kansas City you will have an opportunity to check out one of the most amazing
                        collections of paper money the Midwest has to offer. Kansas City is the home of the Tenth
                        Federal Reserve Bank Headquarters. At their money museum you can see a display of the 1928
                        $100,000 Gold Certificate serial #2. That’s not all! They also possess some ultra rare large
                        size Gold Certificates as well. It is a high quality museum that is open to the public free of
                        charge. The Money Museum is a short ride or a good walk from our venue.</p>
