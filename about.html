                    <p>
                        Each year our speaker's series has brought our guests the brightest minds in the area of
                        Currency and Currency related research. Our free speaker's series will bring the most active
                        people in the hobby a truly unprecedented opportunity to absorb quality information that is both
                        new and fresh. Given the fact that much of the information has yet to be published, our
                        speaker's series could be just the thing to give you the advantage all collectors hope for and
                        dream of.

                        you've reached as a collector, everyone can and will benefit from learning from each other.
                        There will also be some competitive exhibits that can provide years of knowledge and
                        illuminating presentation.

                    <p>
                        The bourse at the IPMS has always been impressive. When the bell rang at noon on Thursday,
                        dealers raced to man their tables and the early bird badge holders, exhibitors and speakers were
                        close behind, making a beeline to the dealer of their choice. Some amazing material has been in
                        our dealers' cases over the years. This year's IPMS Bourse will consist of over 100 dealers
                        buying and selling US Curency and World Banknotes. Bourse applications are now available! Click
                        button to be a part of this important event!
